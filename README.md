# 🏨 Hotel Reservation System (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Hotel Reservation System** is a Java-based console application designed to manage hotel room bookings efficiently. It allows users to view room availability, book and cancel rooms, and simulate payment processing. Booking data is stored persistently using file handling.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in **Core Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and is suitable for academic projects and internship evaluations.
